  "about": "The Pomodoro technique is a time management method that involves breaking work into 25-minute time blocks, called \"pomodoro\", separated by short rest intervals of 5 minutes. After four pomodoro, a longer break of 15-20 minutes is taken. The goal of the technique is to help people maintain focus and productivity, avoiding procrastination and mental fatigue. The name \"Pomodoro\" means \"tomato\" in Italian and comes from the tomato-shaped kitchen timer that was originally used by the creator of the technique, Francesco Cirillo."
